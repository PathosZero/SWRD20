        "shortDescription": "<p>You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i><i>Dispel</i> magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p><p><i>Targeted</i> <i>Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends.</p><p>If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin</i> (caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly</i> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of</i> fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster <i>summon</i>ed by <i>summon</i> monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of</i> holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>",

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"Come here,\" \"Go there,\" \"Fight,\" and \"Stand still.\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.</p><p>Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).</p><p>Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.</p><p>By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.</p><p>Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.</p><p>If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.</p><p><i>Protection from Evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.</p>",

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand.</p><p>For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your <i>Combat Maneuver</i> Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.</p><p>You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p><p>Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.</p><p>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>",

These spasms cause the victim to be nauseated and deal 1d6 points of damage to Strength and Dexterity due to the painful contortion of bones, muscles, and limbs. The spasms continue for 1d6 hours or until healed with heal, regenerate, or greater restoration. The effects of this ability do not stack, but once a creature has recovered from or been cured of the effect, it can be affected again. Once a creature has made successful saving throw against this effect, it cannot be affected by the wrenching spasms from that particular gigas for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based."
