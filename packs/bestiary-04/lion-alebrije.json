If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.<br><br>\n                When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the source’s location.<br><br>\n                A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility."

You can send and receive these <i>dream</i> messages with a single target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.  If you use <i>dream</i> council to send a message to a sleeping creature that has <i>dream</i> or <i>dream</i> council prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature's prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your <i>dream</i>scape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your <i>dream</i>scape without casting either of those spells. While in the original caster's <i>dream</i>scape, those involved in the council can interact with one another and that <i>dream</i>scape for 10 minutes for each message remaining.

        "shortDescription": "<p>You and the other targets of the spell are physically drawn from the Material Plane into the Dimension of Dreams on a voyage into the <i>dream</i>s of a creature you designate. In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of <i>dream</i>ers everywhere to reach your destination <i>dream</i>scape. Reaching the destination <i>dream</i>scape takes 1 hour. At any point before the spell's duration ends, you can dismiss the spell to return to where you started on the Material Plane. The connection between <i>dream</i>s and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the <i>dream</i>er you're trying to find. To determine how accurate your arrival is at the end of your <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, roll d% on the following table.     <table border ='1'><tr><th>Familiarity</th><th>On Target</th><th>Off Target</th><th>Other</th><th>Dreamscape Mishap</th></tr><tr><td>Very familiar</td><td>1-97</td><td>98-99</td><td>100</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhat familiar</td><td>1-94</td><td>95-97</td><td>98-99</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Known creature</td><td>1-88</td><td>89-94</td><td>95-98</td><td>99-100</td></tr><tr><td>Not well known</td><td>1-76</td><td>77-88</td><td>89-96</td><td>97-100</td></tr><tr><td>False identity</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>81-92</td><td>93-100</td></tr></table>     <br><b>Familiarity</b>: \"Very familiar\" means that you have had contact using <i>dream</i>, <i>dream</i> council, <i>dream</i> scan, or a similar spell within the past 24 hours with the creature whose <i>dream</i>scape you are trying to locate. \"Somewhat familiar\" means that you have had contact with the <i>dream</i>ing character using one of those spells at least once in the past. \"Known creature\" means that while you know the creature whose <i>dream</i>scape you're trying to locate, you have not connected to its <i>dream</i>s with those spells. \"Not well known\" is a creature you have heard of, know by name and true identity, but have never met.  \"False identity\" means that whether or not you have met the creature, you know it only through a false identity. When trying to locate the <i>dream</i>scape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct <i>dream</i>scape.  <br><b>On Target</b>: You travel to the correct creature's current <i>dream</i>scape.  <br><b>Off Target</b>: You travel to an area near the target <i>dream</i>scape on the Ethereal Plane.  <br><b>Other</b> <b>Dreamscape</b>: You travel to a similar creature's <i>dream</i>scape on the Dimension of Dreams.  <br><b>Mishap</b>: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.  Regardless of the accuracy of your <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can't use <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, nor can creatures that can't <i>dream</i>.  You might be able to exit the <i>dream</i> near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a <i>dream</i> when the <i>dream</i>er wakes up, the <i>dream</i>er can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another <i>dream</i>scape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the <i>dream</i>er awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.  You can use <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> to travel to the <i>dream</i> of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the <i>dream</i>s of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination <i>dream</i>, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.   <table border ='1'><tr><th>d6</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either; see page 557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Creature is cursed, as bestow curse; if the creature is a spellcaster, it instead acquires a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 94).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Creature is attacked by a phantasmal killer, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it. The Fortitude save DC is equal to the Will save DC that the creature failed.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Creature is possessed as possession (see page 181) by an outsider (50% chance to be a creature from the destination plane; otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Creature is affected as feeblemind.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Creature is affected as insanity.</td></tr></table>   Traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your <i>dream</i> transit. If you exit a creature's <i>dream</i> onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.  If the target of your <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> isn't <i>dream</i>ing, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>er must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.</p>",
