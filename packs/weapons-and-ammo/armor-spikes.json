      "value": "<p>You can have spikes added to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple attack. If you are not proficient with martial weapons, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use armor spikes.</p>\n<p>You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. You can’t also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes’ effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>"
