Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the <i>entangle</i>d condition.

To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing. If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.</p>",

Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.</p><p> <table><tr><th>Caster Level</th><th>Centipedes</th><th>Scorpions</th><th>Spiders</th></tr><tr><td>9th or lower</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>10th-13th</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>14th-17th</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>18th-19th</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>20th or higher</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></table> </p>",

When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.</p><p> <table><tr><th>Distance</th><th>Time to Locate</th></tr><tr><td>100 ft. or less</td><td>1 round</td></tr><tr><td>1,000 ft.</td><td>1 minute</td></tr><tr><td>1 mile</td><td>10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>2 miles</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>3 miles</td><td>2 hours</td></tr><tr><td>4 miles</td><td>3 hours</td></tr><tr><td>5 miles</td><td>4 hours</td></tr></table>  Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.</p><p>The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you.</p><p>If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.</p><p>If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.</p><p>The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.</p>",

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.</p><p>A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.</p><p>While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.</p><p>Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Chapter 13).</p><p>A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.</p>",

The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense what cavern corridor to take when a choice presents itself. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. <i>Find the path</i> can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a <i>maze</i> spell in a single round, specifying the destination as \"outside the <i>maze</i>.\" This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.</p>",

        "shortDescription": "<p>With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p><p>Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death.</p><p>The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p><p>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p><p>It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.</p><p>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.</p><p>A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.</p><p>Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p><p> <table><tr><th>d%</th><th>Incarnation</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>Bugbear</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>02-13</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>14-25</td><td>Elf</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Gnoll</td><td>+4</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>27-38</td><td>Gnome</td><td>-2</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>39-42</td><td>Goblin</td><td>-2</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>43-52</td><td>Half-elf</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>53-62</td><td>Half-orc</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>63-74</td><td>Halfling</td><td>-2</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>75-89</td><td>Human</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>90-93</td><td>Kobold</td><td>-4</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>94</td><td>Lizardfolk</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>95-98</td><td>Orc</td><td>+4</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td>Troglodyte</td><td>+0</td><td>-2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Other (GM's choice)</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr></table>  The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.</p><p>A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.</p>",
